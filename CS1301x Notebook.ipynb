    "**Algorithm :** Algorithm: Technically, a collection of steps that transforms input into output; commonly, a complex set of lots of steps that is only feasible to perform with the efficiency of a computer.  \n",

    "**Complexity :** The rate at which the number of operations requires to run an algorithm grows based on the value of the input on which it operates.  \n",

    "\n",
    "There also exist Big Ω (Omega) Notation, which expresses the best-case efficiency of an algorithm, and Big θ (Theta) Notation, which expresses the typical-case efficiency of an algorithm. Big O is used most commonly.\n",
    "\n",
    "These various values exist, though, because some algorithms are generally very efficiency, but are very inefficient with certain types of data. For example, there exists a sorting algorithm called QuickSort that is generally extremely efficient, but whose efficiency plummets if there are a lot of duplicate values in the data set that it's sorting.  \n",

    "**Recursion :** A programming method characterized by functions that, during their operation, call additional copies of themselves; see also, recursion. Recursion involves breaking down a problem into smaller instances recursively until each of them can be independently solved. Solutions to these smaller instances combine to form the solution for the original problem. A repeated application of a specific function, within the function.  \n",
    "**Tail vs. Head Recursion :** Head recursion occurs when the recursive call is near the beginning of the function, before other reasoning or code. Tail recursion occurs when the recursive call is closer to the end of the function, after some other reasoning or code.  \n",
    "**Sorting Algorithms :** Algorithms that take as input a list, and produce as output a sorted version of that list. Examples include bubble sort,  insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, shell sort, quick sort, and heap sort. \n",
